## Overview

Welcome to the Interactive Spherical Icosahedron project! This application allows you to visualize and interact with an
icosahedron on a unit sphere. With this tool, you can select and subdivide triangles to explore finer details of the
icosahedron.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Rotate and zoom into the icosahedron using your mouse.
- **Triangle Subdivision**: Select any triangle and subdivide it into four smaller triangles.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The visualization updates dynamically with each subdivision, providing an engaging user
  experience.
